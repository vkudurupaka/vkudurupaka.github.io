<div class="question">Q1. Did you create the Terraform pipeline?</div>
<div class="answer">
Yes. I created Terraform CI/CD pipelines including init, validate, plan, approval, and apply stages. 
Used S3 backend with DynamoDB for remote state and locking.
</div>

<div class="question">Q2. Did you also create the CloudFormation pipeline?</div>
<div class="answer">
Yes. I implemented CloudFormation pipelines using CodePipeline/Jenkins with template validation, change sets, and controlled deployments.
</div>

<div class="question">Q3. Do you know Kubernetes?</div>
<div class="answer">
Yes. I have experience with Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets, HPA, RBAC, Helm, and EKS cluster management.
</div>

<div class="question">Q4. What is the latest Kubernetes version?</div>
<div class="answer">
Kubernetes versions are currently in the 1.29–1.30 range, with new releases approximately every 4 months.
</div>

<div class="question">Q5. What is the latest EKS version?</div>
<div class="answer">
Amazon EKS typically supports the latest 3–4 Kubernetes versions. Currently around version 1.29 depending on region.
</div>

<div class="question">Q6. What is QoS in Kubernetes?</div>
<div class="answer">
QoS (Quality of Service) defines pod eviction priority during resource pressure. 
Classes are:
<ul>
<li>Guaranteed</li>
<li>Burstable</li>
<li>BestEffort</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="question">Q7. Which QoS class is evicted last?</div>
<div class="answer">
Guaranteed pods are evicted last during resource starvation.
</div>

<div class="question">Q8. How do you configure requests and limits to make a Pod evicted last?</div>
<div class="answer">
Set CPU and Memory requests equal to limits.
<code>
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"
</code>
</div>

<div class="question">Q9. What is a Liveness Probe?</div>
<div class="answer">
A liveness probe checks if a container is running properly. 
If it fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.
</div>

<div class="question">Q10. What is a Readiness Probe?</div>
<div class="answer">
A readiness probe checks if a container is ready to receive traffic. 
If it fails, traffic stops but the container is not restarted.
</div>

<div class="question">Q11. Do you know CloudWatch?</div>
<div class="answer">
Yes. CloudWatch is used for monitoring AWS resources including metrics, logs, alarms, dashboards, and Log Insights queries.
</div>

<div class="question">Q12. Do you know CloudTrail?</div>
<div class="answer">
Yes. CloudTrail records AWS API activity for auditing, governance, and security analysis.
</div>

<div class="question">Q13. Do you know Azure Monitor?</div>
<div class="answer">
Yes. Azure Monitor provides monitoring, Log Analytics, Application Insights, alerts, and KQL-based queries.
</div>

<div class="question">Q14. Do you know Grafana?</div>
<div class="answer">
Yes. Grafana is used for creating monitoring dashboards integrated with Prometheus, CloudWatch, and Azure Monitor.
</div>

<div class="question">Q15. How would you see all CloudWatch logs in one place?</div>
<div class="answer">
Use CloudWatch Log Insights to query multiple log groups or configure centralized cross-account logging with subscription filters.
</div>

<div class="question">Q16. Can a Lambda in Account A send logs to Account B?</div>
<div class="answer">
Yes. This can be achieved using cross-account subscription filters with proper IAM role and resource policy configuration.
</div>

<div class="question">Q17. How would you centralize logs from multiple Lambdas?</div>
<div class="answer">
Create a centralized logging account and use subscription filters to send logs to Kinesis, Firehose, OpenSearch, or S3.
</div>

<div class="question">Q18. Can you write a shell script that accepts one parameter and prints it?</div>
<div class="answer">
<code>
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Please provide a parameter"
  exit 1
fi

echo "You entered: $1"
</code>
